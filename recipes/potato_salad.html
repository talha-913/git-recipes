    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This classic potato salad is the best. Creamy, tangy, and crunchy, with a hint of spice and sweetness from pickles, it reminds me of my grandmother's potato salad served every Easter, or any time we had barbecue. She always dotted it with olives for a finishing touch, and a perfect briny addition. This is the best classic version of good old-fashioned, Southern-style potato salad. Not too much mayonnaise, with just the right amount of tang! Serve with grilled or smoked meats, it's the perfect side dish.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds russet potatoes, peeled </li>
        <li>4 large eggs </li>
        <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste, divided </li>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise </li>
        <li>5 stalks green onions, sliced (white and green parts) </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut potatoes into 1 1/2-inch cubes. Place in a large pot and cover with water by 2 inches. Add eggs and 3 teaspoons salt; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat; simmer 9 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove eggs with a slotted spoon and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking. Continue cooking potatoes until fork-tender, about 1 minute more; drain. </li>
    </ol>
